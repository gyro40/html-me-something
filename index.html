                   <h2>1. 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 650</h2>
                   <p>The 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 650 was the very first motorcycle I have owned. One that quickly taught me, "If you haven't crashed, you will". I totaled the bike within the first 8 months of riding. The Ninja 650 is a great commuter bike, but not a very good beginner bike. I dropped this, brand new, motorcycle multiple times during the shakey learning process.
                       I loved this bike since it was my introduction to the two wheel lifestyle.

                   <h2>2. 2016 Husqvarna FE501s</h2>
                   <p>The 2016 Husqvarna FE501s was the second motorcycle I have owned, and arguably the most fun motorcycle I have ever owned. This bike was originally a dualsport motorcycle, but I quickly changed it to a supermoto. Supermoto bikes are dirt bikes that have been outfitted with 17" wheels that are normally on street bikes. Making them very agile on the pavement as well as the dirt. Making them very versatile and arguably the most pure form of motorcycle riding, Purely man and machine working together. </p>

                   <h2>3. 2004 Kawasaki Z1000</h2>
                   <p>The Kawasaki Z1000 was the third bike I owned. I picked this bike up off a quick trade, and it was not the best decision I have made but I sure did enjoy the bike while I owned it. This bike was bought purely for fun and to try out the 1000cc motorcycles. This bike taught me that I like to ride slow bikes fast more than riding a fast bike slow.</p>

                   <h2>4. 2009 Kawasaki Versys 650</h2>
                   <p>The Versys 650 is the newest bike to me. Its more of an upright sport touring motorcycle made for comfort and road tripping. The perfect motorcycle for me! So far the bike has been to Colorado twice since I've bought it a little over 6 months ago. This bike is nowhere near a perfect bike, but it is the perfect bike for me! </p>
